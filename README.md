This project implements a unit conversion tool using JavaScript and Bootstrap 
for a responsive design. It provides functionalities to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, 
kilograms to pounds, and kilometers to miles. The code validates user input to ensure 
only non-negative numbers are processed. Invalid inputs trigger alerts, improving usability. 
Bootstrap is used to style the HTML page, ensuring compatibility across devices and screen 
sizes. The project is ideal for learning JavaScript DOM manipulation and form validation 
in a structured, user-friendly format.
